# Implemented API · v1

All endpoints use `/api/v1` except health. All write bodies are strict JSON. Unknown fields are rejected. Errors use `application/problem+json` with `type`, `title`, `status`, `detail`, `requestId`; no SQL, stack, token or request-body echo. All dates are UTC ISO 8601. Public collection limit defaults to 20, maximum 50. Use returned cursors unchanged.

| Method | Route | Authentication | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health/live` | None | Liveness `{status:"ok"}` |
| GET | `/health/ready` | None | Executes `SELECT 1`; readiness |
| GET | `/posts?limit=20&cursor=...` | None | Published summaries and cursor pagination |
| GET | `/posts/:slug` | None | Published article with Markdown and media |
| POST | `/admin/posts` | Owner JWT | Create draft/published article; 201 and ETag |
| GET | `/admin/posts/:id` | Owner JWT | Read any status; ETag |
| PUT | `/admin/posts/:id` | Owner JWT + If-Match | Full replacement; version increments; 412 if stale |
| POST | `/admin/media/uploads` | Owner JWT | Create private presigned PUT URL; 201 |
| POST | `/admin/media/:id/complete` | Owner JWT | Verify/re-encode/publish image |
| GET | `/chat/config` | None | Current `enabled:false` configuration |
| POST | `/chat/sessions` | None | Mint 60-minute anonymous capability; 201 |
| GET | `/chat/sessions/:id` | Session bearer | Current empty history contract |
| DELETE | `/chat/sessions/:id` | Session bearer | Delete/revoke session; 204 |
| POST | `/chat/sessions/:id/messages` | Session bearer | Validate request; 503 until AI integration |

Post write example:

```json
{"slug":"building-useful-interfaces","title":"Building useful interfaces","excerpt":"Notes from practice.","bodyMarkdown":"# An idea\n\nWrite the article here.","tags":[{"slug":"react","name":"React"}],"mediaIds":[],"coverImageId":null,"isDemo":false,"status":"draft"}
```

Status: `draft | published | archived`. To publish or unpublish, PUT the complete write object with the new status and `If-Match: "1"` (use the latest GET ETag). Publishing sets the first publication timestamp. Archived/draft records return 404 publicly. Slugs are lowercase words/digits separated by hyphens. Existing slugs can change, but redirect creation is not implemented; avoid changing published slugs until redirects are added. A slug collision returns 409. Missing If-Match is 428; stale version is 412. Owner write results are `{data:{...article,status,mediaIds,coverImageId}}`, with draft `publishedAt:null`.

Public article:

```json
{"data":{"id":"8318a34f-1484-4eb8-8ab1-b3a1378a2d8c","slug":"building-useful-interfaces","title":"Building useful interfaces","excerpt":"Notes from practice.","publishedAt":"2026-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2026-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","readingTimeMinutes":1,"tags":[{"slug":"react","name":"React"}],"coverImage":null,"isDemo":false,"bodyMarkdown":"# An idea\n\nWrite the article here.","media":[]}}
```

List `{data:[...summaries],pagination:{limit:20,hasMore:false,nextCursor:null}}`; summary excludes `bodyMarkdown` and `media`. Media entries: `{id,url,alt,width,height,caption:null}`. Source files must be finalized before media IDs can be attached to a post. Draft article visibility does not make already-finalized media private: finalization deliberately publishes its rendition. Use this only for public portfolio images; private draft-media publication workflows remain future work.

Upload request: `{contentType:"image/png",sizeBytes:125000,alt:"Diagram explaining the design"}`. Response `{data:{id,uploadUrl,method:"PUT",headers:{"Content-Type":"image/png"},expiresInSeconds:300}}`. PUT exactly those bytes/type to the URL, then POST `{}` to `/admin/media/:id/complete`. Response `{data:{id,url,width,height}}`. No presigned URL is logged or persisted. Processing is claimed atomically; repeated/expired/in-progress finalization returns 409. Failure marks upload failed; request a new upload. Finalization has multiple external steps rather than a distributed transaction: monitor/reconcile rare public-orphan objects after a process crash and expire original uploads using R2 lifecycle.

Chat session POST body `{}`; response `{data:{id,token,expiresAt}}`. Token is returned once, 256 random bits, stored server-side only as SHA-256, and sent subsequently as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Tokens never go in a URL or browser persistent storage. Invalid/missing/expired session returns 401. DELETE revokes the capability; repeated delete returns 401 (frontend treats expired/revoked state through its session recovery flow). No transcripts are stored before AI integration.

Message body `{clientMessageId:"uuid",content:"Tell me about Sai",pagePath:"/"}`; content 1–2000 trimmed characters, no unsafe controls. Paths local, maximum 240, no query/fragment. Current response is 503 Problem Details, never fake model output.

Rate limits: 120 API requests/minute/IP; 30 admin requests/minute/IP; 10 media requests/minute/IP; 5 session creations/hour/IP; 10 message requests/minute/IP. Counters are shared PostgreSQL rows with HMAC identifiers. IP addresses are not stored as raw counter keys. Limits fail closed on database failure. Responses expose standardized rate headers and 429/Retry-After. Apply edge limits before the database for hostile traffic. IPv6 subnet handling uses express-rate-limit defaults.

These contracts supersede the corresponding earlier .NET design for implemented routes. Earlier planned admin cookie/CSRF contracts are replaced here by owner OIDC bearer validation. The wider CMS specification remains a roadmap, not implemented API documentation.


## Security and operations

# Security scope

Implemented controls: strict Zod input/environment schemas; parameterized SQL; least-information errors; Helmet; exact-origin CORS; authenticated owner subject allowlist; JOSE issuer/audience/signature/expiry validation; certificate-verified database TLS; atomic shared rate counters with HMAC IP keys; bounded request sizes; upload type/size/pixel validation; random object names; metadata-stripping WebP re-encoding; separate private/public buckets; expiring hashed chat capabilities; optimistic concurrency and transactional post/audit writes; non-root container; graceful shutdown; migration checksums and locking.

No application can promise absolute safety from scaffolding alone. Credentials, TLS ingress, network boundaries, database grants, R2 policies, identity provider MFA, backups, monitoring, service patching and deployment verification are operational responsibilities. Authentication is disabled (503), not bypassed, when owner configuration is absent. Unconfigured R2 likewise returns 503. No live AI provider exists yet.

Known operational boundaries: public read collection currently resolves media per article (bounded to 50); tune with batch loading if needed. R2/DB finalization has no distributed transaction; orphan reconciliation and private-object lifecycle must be configured. Rate limiting consumes DB work; deploy edge limiting in front. Audit actor IDs are personal data: protect access and enforce the 90-day retention task. Health endpoints are lightweight but should also have edge throttling. Root request timeouts should be reviewed when SSE is enabled. The app does not render raw HTML from Markdown; consumers must retain their own safe renderer policy. Draft media rendition finalization publishes the image even if its article is still a draft.

CI tests HTTP boundaries and actual SQL semantics against PGlite; it does not prove hosted Neon, OIDC/JWKS, R2, container networking or browser behavior. Run those staging gates before enabling public production traffic. CI dependency scanning is one check, not a security certification.


## Future scope

The original full-CMS proposal remains in `archive/04-backend-requirements.md`; its .NET stack and cookie authentication are superseded. `openapi.json` at this documentation root describes the larger planned CMS, not all implemented endpoints. Consult the backend repository’s `docs/openapi.json` for current routes. Live AI requirements are in `09-ai-chat-requirements.md` and `10-backend-implementation.md`.
